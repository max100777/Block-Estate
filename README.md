## 🔍 Overview

**Block Estate** is a decentralized real estate trading platform enabling users to list, tokenize, and purchase properties using blockchain technology. Built on Ethereum with Solidity smart contracts, it supports both **full and fractional ownership**, making real estate investment more accessible and flexible.

Transactions are powered by **ETH** and secured via **MetaMask**, while development and testing are conducted on a local **Ganache blockchain**.
